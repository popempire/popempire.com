As unexpected as the Spanish Inquisition, it's **_the Pop Empire newsletter!!_**

This mailing list has been collected (very slowly) over the fifteen years that
this musical project has existed, though I don't believe we have ever sent out a
direct communication through this channel.

Going forward, we intend this to be a primary platform through which we share
updates about new recordings, shows, merch, and other creative work, along with
behind-the-scenes material, unofficial (secret) releases, reflections on the 
creative process, and explorations of the backstories and inspirations for 
certain songs and works.

Some of you may not have realized 
that you were subscribed to the Popular Imperial mailing list — if this is 
something that you don't want cluttering up your inbox, you can easily request
to be unsubscribed by following the instructions at the bottom of this email.

### Last Lights Off the Black West

The last several years of our musical work has culminated in an album that I
have titled *Last Lights Off the Black West*. This title is taken from the lines
of a sonnet written in 1877 by Gerard Manley Hopkins. This poem has long held a
special place for me — I first memorized it when I was eighteen or nineteen — 
but only a couple years ago I realized I could set it to music by repurposing
the tune of "Sittin' On Top Of the World" aka "Some Summer Day". That's when I
began developing it as a song, along with the rest of the little clan of songs
that would become the material of this new album.

  > And though the **last lights off the black West** went,  
  >   Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs —  
  > Because the Holy Ghost over the bent  
  >   World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings

Although he is now regarded as one of the best English poets of the Victorian 
era, his poetry was not published until many years after his death, and he
nearly gave up writing poems entirely when he joined the Jesuit order. He burned
all his old poetry and vowed not to write again unless directed to do so by his
superiors.

He did take up writing again, however, with the approval of his spiritual
director. The occasion that spurred or at least solidified his return to verse
was a great civilian tragedy, the sinking of the passenger ship *SS Deutschland*,
carrying emigrants bound for New York.

His immediate and extended family on both sides was full of literary and visually
artistic minds. Gerard inherited these inclination along with the devout 
religiosity and reverence for Nature that were also characteristic of his family.
In particular, many of the female members of his family were well educated and 
artistically accomplished. Beyond this intellectual stimulation, it seems his
family was, all in all, quite affectionate. However, his conversion to Roman
Catholicism caused a significant estrangement betweeen him and his Anglican
family, the pain of which seems to have been felt acutely on both sides.

Hopkins died in 1889, one hundred years before I was born.

Hopkins, in his internal life, struggled extensively with the demon of *acedia*.

Hopkins coined the term "sprung rhythm" and is considered the originator of that
metrical style in modern English verse, although I believe that in fact he was 
correct to say that this is the *natural* prosody of native English speakers,
and that he merely identified and named it. *Sprung rhythm* was not in general
use in formal verse in the Victorian era, but it had never disappeared from
popular song and nursery rhymes, and it would make a brilliant return to the
arena of "serious" poetry in the works of Modernist poets such as Dylan Thomas,
writing several decades after Hopkins' death but only a short while after the
publication of his works.

Digging into the nitty gritty,
"God's Grandeur," written just a year or so after Hopkins's return to poetry,
is scanned by the author as a specimen of *counterpointed common verse*. Sprung
rhythm arises naturally where common verse (i.e. lines made up of repeated feet 
with a regular stress pattern and number of syllables, also called "running
rhythm" by Hopkins) is reversed or counterpointed. Counterpoint, in Hopkins's
usage here, is the superposition of a new lyrical rhythm on top of an already
established rhythm. He employed this term in analogy with musical counterpoint,
which is the superposition of a new melody on top of an established one. In 
modern parlance, it would seem to make more sense to call this *syncopation* or
*polyrhythm*,
which are hallmarks of music influenced by traditional African styles,
as these terms pretty well fit the meaning of Hopkins's *reversed*
and *counterpointed* verse without resort to any mediating analogy. Yet these
terms were not widespread in the theoretical analysis or even in the practice of
European music in Hopkins's day.

Hopkins's style has been very influential on me, not just sprung rhythm, but 
other lyrical eccentricities too — grammatical practices, such as rambling 
adjectival phrases that swallow whole clauses. A good example of this is found
in "The Windhover" (emphasis mine):

  > I caught this morning morning's minion, king-  
  >   dom of daylight's dauphin, *dapple-dawn-drawn* Falcon, in his riding  
  >   Of *the rolling level underneath him steady* air, and striding...

Lines from Pop Empire songs such as "Nightwalking" and "Riding the Crest" take
inspiration from this.

  > In the high sodium-vapor-yellow  
  > lonesome air, the silent twilight's fall
  > silhoueettes a figure...

  > Riding on that crest of silver starlight
  > Dazzled dim, dark water by the shore...

The first of these excerpts, from our song "Nightwalking", also borrows from 
Joseph Campbell's "Gartan Mother's Lullaby" (1904), and the latter, from our song 
"Riding the Crest", makes clear allusion to Yeats's "Aedh Wishes For the Cloths
of Heaven" (1899).
