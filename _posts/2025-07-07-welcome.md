As unexpected as the Spanish Inquisition, it's **_the Pop Empire newsletter!!_**

This mailing list has been collected (very slowly) over the fifteen years that
this musical project has existed, though I don't believe we have ever sent out a
direct communication through this channel.

Going forward, we intend this to be a primary platform through which we share
updates about new recordings, shows, merch, and other creative work, along with
behind-the-scenes material, unofficial (secret) releases, reflections on the 
creative process, and explorations of the backstories and inspirations for 
certain songs and works.

Some of you may not have realized 
that you were subscribed to the Popular Imperial mailing list â€” if this is 
something that you don't want cluttering up your inbox, you can easily request
to be unsubscribed by following the instructions at the bottom of this email.
