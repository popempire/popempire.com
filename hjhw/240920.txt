Writing challenge continues! I've put it off till the end of the day
again. It may become necessary to reduce the writing time to 20 minutes
per day, but we'll see.

RuPaul's drag race is playing on the TV in front of me as I do this
writing. Let's see if I stay focused.

I agreed to the show at Motr on 10/2 with Rickshaw Billie's Burger
Patrol from Austin and Dioptra from here in town. Burger Patrol played
at Levitation last year and are doing so again this year. That's pretty
cool! That's one of the only festivals that I'd truly love to play.
Jake is not available for this date, so I'll be playing alone. I hope I
do a good job!

I'm curious how best to spend this writing time. Writing freeform train
of thought reflections about my day and recent activities is fine, but
I think there are lots of little projects that I could work on during
this time. Let's start a list!

 - writing notes on the songs on the upcoming Pop Empire album
 - writing notes on old songs or albums or recordings
 - writing narratives of notable stories from my life
     + the penguin story
     + the night my minivan spun off the road
 - writing lyrical ideas
     + radium girls
     + make your motor hum
     + whole lotta love in the world
     + red is the color

I think I could also work on compiling descriptions of the way I have
organized my creative environment, e.g. my live and studio setups. For
example:
