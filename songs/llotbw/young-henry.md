```
    [verse 1]

    G               C     G 
    Lie down, young Hen - ry  

        C                   G
    and stay all night with me  

               C       G
    The golden cords a-round my bed  

          C              G
    shall be supplied to thee  
```
```
    [verse 2]

             C         G
    Oh no, I can't lie down  

        C                   G
    nor stay all night with thee  

                   C           G
    for I've got a girl in the sweet sunny South  

        C                            G
    and tonight she's waitin' up for me  
```

       D               C          G
    He leaned her up a-gainst the wall  

        C                       G
    and kissed her there in the dark  

    D               C          G           Gm
    She wrapped her arms all a-round and a-round  

        C                       G
    and stabbed him through his heart  
```
```
    [verse 4]

    D                C       G   
    Lie there, false-heart - ed Henry  

             C                   G   
    till the flesh rot from your bone  

    D           C           G           Gm
    That little girl in the sweet sunny South  

        C              G 
    may wait for you a-lone
