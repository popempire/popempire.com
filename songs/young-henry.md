    [G]Lie down, young [C]Hen[G]ry  
    and [C]stay all night with [G]me  
    The golden [C]cords a[G]round my bed  
    shall [C]be supplied to [G]thee  

    Oh no, I [C]can't lie [G]down  
    nor [C]stay all night with [G]thee  
    for I've got a [C]girl in the [G]sweet sunny South  
    and [C]tonight she's waitin' up for [G]me  

    He [D]leaned her up a[C]gainst the [G]wall  
    and [C]kissed her there in the [G]dark  
    [D]She wrapped her [C]arms all a[G]round and a[Gm]round  
    and [C]stabbed him through his [G]heart  

    [D]Lie there, false-[C]heart[G]ed Henry  
    till the [C]flesh rot from your [G]bone  
    [D]That little [C]girl in the [G]sweet sunny [Gm]South  
    may [C]wait for you a[G]lone
