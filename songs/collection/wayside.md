### Lyrics ###

~~~
Standing on the corner with a nickel or a dime
There used to be a rail car to take you down the line
Too much beer and whiskey to ever be employed
And when I got to Nashville, it was too much soldier's joy
Wasted on the wayside, wasted on the way
If I don't go tomorrow, you know I'm gone today

Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine

Black highway all night ride
Watching the times fall away to the side
Clear channel way down low
It's comin' in loud and my mind let go

Peaches in the summertime, apples in the fall
If I can't have you all the time, I won't have none at all
Oh, I wish I was in Frisco in a brand new pair of shoes
I'm sittin' here in Nashville with Norman's Nashville blues
So come all you good time rounders listenin' to my sound
Then drink a round to Nashville before they tear it down

Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine

Hard weather, drivin' slow
Buggies and the hats are in town for the show
Oh darlin, the songs they played
Are all I got left of the love we made

Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
