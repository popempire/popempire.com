My baby is all Summer then she's all Winter
She don't celebrate the Fall
She don't tolerate no Evil to be found
She's the sweetest thing, she's my girl

My baby is cool silver and stately black
She can operate my gun
She don't contemplate no evil against her man
She's the Sweetest Thing she's my girl

I don't dream sweet dreams about her
I can't sleep sweet sleep without her
I can't tease apart the day
She's the sweet sweet sweetest thing
So pretty as she lies
Nothing beautiful is true
