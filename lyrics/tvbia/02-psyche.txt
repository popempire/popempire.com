Have you seen my baby
walkin side of the road?
if you see my baby lord she ain't
got no place to go

who's gonna shoe her little feet?
who's gonna glove her hands?
who's gonna kiss her red red lips?
who's gonna be her man?

who's gonna be her man?

she's a cold infinite wave
discretely symbolized
she is not what she is
soul not of a man

Psyche walk beside me
dark end of the road
can't find no hearts to bind no
place like home

brightness of midnight
is ever around her
loneliness and death-rattle
stillness go beside her

who's gonna be her man?
