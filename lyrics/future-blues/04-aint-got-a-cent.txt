I work so hard an try to pay my rent
Swear I had the check I don't know where it went
Got it and it on all in cash
Got it and it's gone all in a flash

God help me if you can
    but if you can't just let me be
cause I ain't got a cent in the land of the free

Jesus sent his people out in the land
said "You shall be known by works of your hands"
But in this country they just don't give a damn
I'm just fingerprints and numbers to old uncle sam

God help me if you can
    but if you can't just let me be
cause I ain't got a cent in the land of the free

Almighty dollar don't abide no crime
in love's supreme justice gotta do your time
"Young man ain't worth much in the world these days"
But an old man's broker than two feet of clay

God help me if you can
    but if you can't just let me be
cause I ain't got a cent in the land of the free

Dig my grave with a silver spade
Lay me down with a golden chain
Lay my corporation in six foot of ground
Poor man dig a hold to put the rich man down

I didn't say I was a millionaire
    but if I was I woulda spent it all
Cause I ain't got a cent in the land of the free
