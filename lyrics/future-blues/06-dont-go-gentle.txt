Yeah the dead rise up but they do not hear
The old story longs for feeling my dear
Your pretty little sould is all skin and bone
Dear old Saxon words in the great unkown

"Everybody must get stoned"
Another breath could break my bones
How I hate to see you go
but how I'd keep you I don't know

Bob Dylan's dead and there's no prophets here
Intoxication's had a real good year
"I see you boys of summer in your ruin"
You can wake me up after the revolution

"Everybody must get stoned"
Another breath could break my bones
How I hate to see you go
but how I'd keep you I don't know
