Black Dog Blues
---------------

### Lyrics 

    Black dog in the garden, tell me where your friend has gone
    Black dog in the garden, I wonder where your friend has gone
    Every time I strain my voice I see you in my mind
    What shall be the last thing that you hear?

    I followed her to the graveyard—heart felt cold, the sky was gray
    I followed her to the graveyard—sky was cold and heart was gray
    I was troubled by a dream I had, I saw you dressed in white
    Lying there with no one by your side

    So I asked that undertaker to give me back my good friend, please
    I asked that undertaker, Give me back my good friend, please
    She looked me in the eye, said, I'm sorry, don't you know?
    Your loving friend has said her last goodbye

    Remember when you told me, you said you wish you was a tree?
    Walking in the garden, said you wish you was a tree
    I should like to get to know you then—I'd sleep beneath your shade
    Soft breeze be the last thing that I hear
