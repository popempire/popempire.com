### Lyrics

    Where gentle tides go rolling by
    Along the salt sea strand
    The colors blend and roll as one
    Together in the sand
    And like a lovesick leannan-sidhe
    She has my heart in thrall
    Nor life I owe, nor liberty
    For love is lord of all

    How cheerfully he seems to grin
    How neatly spreads his claws
    And welcomes little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws
    There on the cricket's singing-stone
    She spares the bogwood fire
    And hums in sad, sweet undertone
    The song of heart's desire
