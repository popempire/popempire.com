Mother Earth
------------

by Memphis Slim, 1951

### Lyrics

    You may high hat me all the time
    You may never go my way
    Mother Earth is lying there for you
    'Cause of that debt you've got to pay

    I don't care how great you are
    Don't care what you're worth
    When it all ends up you've got to go on back home to Mother Earth

    You may play the race horses
    You may own a race track
    You may have enough money, baby,
    To buy anything you lack

    [Refrain]

    You may own half a city
    Even diamonds and pearls
    You may buy an airplane, baby,
    And fly all over this world

    [Refrain]

    When it all ends up you've got to go on back home to Mother Earth
