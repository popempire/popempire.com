Dying Silver Dagger Blues
-------------------------

    Don't sing love songs, you'll wake my mother
    who's lying in her bed next door
    In her right hand is a silver dagger
    that once was red before

    "All men are false," so says my mother
    "They'll tell you wicked loving lies
    The very next evening go and court another,
    and leave you alone to pine and sigh"

    But my Johnny is a handsome devil
    He's got a chain five miles long
    From every link there's a dangling heart
    of a girl he loved and wronged

    He's got coal black curls on his cheekbones
    eyes like a sapphire mine
    shiny limousine of resplendent ruby
    silk and satin inside

    He's got the nerve to drive me wild
    and call me his pretty thing
    Those other girls just don't know how
    to love him the way I do

    Mama, I know that he needs me
    Papa, I need him too
    He's never had a loving family
    and he'll never be untrue

    That's no way to treat your mother
    who taught you better besides
    Wait around till Tuesday, mama
    come and get your silver dagger blues

    Don't she look good in photographs?
    Don't she look good on the floor?
    Don't she look good with her hands held back
    behind her, saying "I wanna be your girl"

    I can't tell a story, I can't tell a lie
    I saw your loving Johnny here with young Nelly Bly
    Frankie looked over and saw to her surprise
    Johnny's head between Nelly's thighs

    One goes out to the love I gave you
    Two is for the lover who will never save you
    and number three will keep you true to me
    don't forget your silver dagger bluesâ€”
    comin' round with the dying silver dagger blues
