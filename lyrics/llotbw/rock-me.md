Rock Me (Hide Me in Thy Bosom)
------------------------------

Composed by Rev. Thomas Dorsey (1937?)

Recorded by Sister Rosetta Tharpe during her first session (1938)

Recorded by Blind Willi McTell (1949, and another?)

My lyrics are slightly modified (as are those of every recorded version!)

### Lyrics

    Mother, hear me praying
    Hear these words I keep saying
    Wash my soul with water from on high
    There's a world of fear around me
    You know evil thoughts will bind me
    Lover, if you leave me I will die

    You gotta hide me in thy bosom
    Till the storm of life is over, baby
    Rock me in the cradle of your love
    Just feed me till I want no more
    Take me to thy blessed home above

    Make my journey brighter
    Make my burden lighter
    Help me to do good wherever I can
    Just let thy presence thrill me
    Let your Holy Spirit fill me
    Hide me in the hollow of thy hand

    Hide me in thy bosom
    Till the storm of life is over, baby
    Rock me in the cradle of your love
    Just feed me till I want no more
    Take me to thy blessed home above

    Faith I am maintaining
    I go on uncomplaining
    But before this time another year
    My life may all forsake me
    Death may overtake me
    I'm with you I have no need to fear

    Because you hide me in thy bosom
    Till the storm of life is over, baby
    Rock me in the cradle of your love
    Just feed me till I want no more
    Take me to thy blessed home above
    Take me to thy blessed home above
