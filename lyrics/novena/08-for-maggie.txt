FOR MAGGIE

I am a child of earth and starry sky.
I was born--born to die.
Lay me in the water, lay me to drown--
wake me up from the lake of memory.

I'll go down--down to hell and meet 'em.
I'll go down and nevermore go there.
It was late in the night—they were both sleeping--
little Maggie appeared, standing by the bed.

Saying, "How do you like your snow white pillow?
And how do you like your soft white sheet?
How do you like that sweet thing lying in your arms--
lyin' in your arms--arms asleep?"

Well, my friend, I believe you're dying.
I tried to take you with me, tried to bring you back.
It was all in your mind--all in your mind.

I am a child of earth and starry sky.
I was born--born to die.
Lay me in the water--lay me to drown--
wake me up—lake of memory.
