I know my shoes are gettin' thin
Don't say I don't have a soul
I got twenty-four dollars in the bank
But I'm still rich on the whole

You're all right, you're all right
It's okay to get down sometimes
You're all right, you're all right
It's nothing

I never owned a pretty car
But I can always get from A to B
I sold my lovely first guitar, it's true
But I still pick out a chord or two

You're all right, you're all right
It's okay to get down sometimes
You're all right, you're all right
It's nothing

You're all right, you're all right
It's okay to get down sometimes
You're all right, you're all right
It's nothing
