title: Young Henry, parts I and II
notes: |
    This song has also been known as "Henry Lee" (as by Dick Justice)
    and earlier as "Young Hunting" (Child No. 68).

    Bronson pp. 174-178

    The tune used in this version is a new invention which came to me
    on my drive back from Albuquerque NM to Cincinnati OH (January 2019, I think)
    although it was not until some while later that I connected it to the text.

    I tried the tunes used on this album for "Tom Dula" and "Young Henry" swapped.

#### part 1

    Lie down, young Henry  
    and stay all night with me  
    The golden cords around my bed  
    shall be supplied to thee  

    Oh no, I can't lie down  
    nor stay all night with thee  
    for I've got a girl in the sweet sunny South  
    and tonight she's waitin' up for me  

    He leaned her up against the wall  
    and kissed her there in the dark  
    She wrapped her arms all around and around  
    and stabbed him through his heart  

    Lie there, false-hearted Henry  
    till the flesh rot from your bone  
    That little girl in the sweet sunny South  
    may wait for you alone  

#### part 2

    Fly down, you little bird  
    and light upon my knee  
    Your cage shall be of purest gold  
    with bands of ivory  

    Oh no, I can't fly down  
    nor light upon thy knee  
    a girl who'd murder her own true love  
    would kill a little bird like me  

    It's if I had my bow  
    with arrow upon the string  
    I'd pierce a dart so nigh your heart  
    your warble would be in vain  

    It's if you had your bow  
    with arrow upon the string  
    I'd fly away to the sweet sunny South  
    and tell what I have seen
