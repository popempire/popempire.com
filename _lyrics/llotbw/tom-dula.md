title: Tom Dula
notes: |
    This text is better known as "Tom Dooley", as recorded by Doc Watson or The Kingston Trio.
    The concerned fellow's name, as it was originally spelled, was *Dula*, while "Dooley"
    represents the Appalachian pronunciation of this name, as most names and words ending with "-a"
    were modified to "-ey" in this dialect. Consistent with this, Doc also sings of "poor Laurie
    Foster" in this song, whom we would recognize as *Laura* Foster.

    The tune is a new one for this text. It is based loosely on "Little Maggie" as sung by
    Karen Dalton.

    Hang down your head, Tom Dula
    Hang your head and cry
    You killed little Laura Foster
    and you know you're bound to die

    You took her on the hillside
    gonna make her your wife
    took her on the mountainside
    and there you took her life

    You dug the grave four feet long
    dug it three feet deep
    rolled that cold clay over her
    and tromped it with your feet

    Hang down your head, Tom Dula
    Hang your head and cry
    You killed little Laura Foster,
    poor boy, your'e bound to die

    In this world then one more
    reckon where I'll be
    down some lonesome hollow
    hanging from a white oak tree

    You can take down my old violin
    and play it all you please
    At this time tomorrow, boys,
    it'll be of no use to me

    Hang down your head, Tom Dula
    Hang your head and cry
    You killed little Laura Foster
    and you know you're bound to die

    You don't love—
        love what's good
    You just love to feel good—
        love to feel good
