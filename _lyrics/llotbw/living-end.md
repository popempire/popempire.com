### Lyrics

    I get ahead on my motorbike
    I get ahead on my motorbike
    I feel so quick in my leather boots
    I feel so quick in my leather boots
    My mood is black when my jacket's on
    My mood is black when my jacket's on

    And I'm in love with myself
    And I'm in love with myself
    There's nothing else but me
    There's nothing else but me
    And the empty road
    And the cool, cool breeze
    Makes me feel so good
    Just like I knew it would
    Like I knew it would

    I get so wild on my motorbike
    I get so wild on my motorbike
    I'm breaking loose on this moonlit night
    I'm breaking loose on this moonlit night
    I cut the road like a sharpened knife
    I cut the road like a sharpened knife

    And I'm in love with myself
    And I'm in love with myself
    There's nothing else but me
    There's nothing else but me
    And the empty road
    And the cool, cool breeze
    Makes me feel so good
    Just like I knew it would
    Like I knew it would

    I'm moving so fast, you know it gets so fast
    I'm moving so fast that I can't control the wheels
    I'm moving too fast, you know it gets so fast
    I'm going for a tree, it's coming for me
    My head is dripping into my leather boots
