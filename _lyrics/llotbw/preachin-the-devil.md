Preachin' The Devil
-------------------

    Who kissed you, Sleeping Beauty?
    Who gave you those clothes to wear?
    Who turned on the lights in here?
    Who cut your long red hair?
    You look so good and evil
    When you get down on your knees
    You look good enough for Jesus, mama
    Good enough for me

    The finest things in life are mine
    To give to them that serve
    Dust returns to dust
    You only get what you deserve
    Preacher have you told them
    That Hell is real?
    The big one's coming, sure as Hell
    And no one's at the wheel

    [Refrain]
    Put me down
    Put me down with your blessed
    Put me down
    I'm just tryna confess it

    I've slicked my teeth with venom
    To keep safe that sacred flame
    Who do you love now, mama?
    I hope you guessed my name
    I want one third of all you angels
    To come down and keep me satisfied
    Run and tell your little sister
    About the man who lied

    [Refrain x2]
