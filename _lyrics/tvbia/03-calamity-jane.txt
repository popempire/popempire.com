I've been travelling
across the desert
they call me
the passing breeze
brothers and sisters
I have plenty
they don't know me
I'm from the open road

I'm gonna go someplace
warm and dark and lovely
I'm gonna seat all of my children
round the table

Mom and dad
I can't stay here
I've gotta leave
leave my old home
lord I'm going
land of plenty
milk and honey
wear my brand new clothes

I'm gonna strip my mind
of flesh and bone and body
I'm gonna see all of my friends
that I have missed
missed...

Calamity Jane
what's the matter with you?
why don't you love me
like you used to do?
You know my hair
is still curly
and my eyes, lord, my eyes
are still blue
ah!

Why don't you love me?
why don't you love me?
