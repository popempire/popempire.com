Trials troubles tribulations
  such as
        never
been before    when
  The sun don't shine
               his
  light & the moon
all die of fright
    fire come down
  from heaven the blood
shall fill the sea

I've been chosen & anointed
  I am
        come
at the dawn of  time
  so like lightning
              strike
the east
              flash!
              far out into the west
  I am death
    there is no fullness
without me

The mark
    must be upon
        your forehead
these worldly goods  you
              then
can buy       Depart
    from   me         I
never knew you
i hear my blessed savior
                  cry no
second sight no soft wind
                    blows
  no hope for rest

  " I am Death
there is no fullness without me "
