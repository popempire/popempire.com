In your time of the heart's desolation--
    the imperial peace of despair--
I don't call it brave to feel no fear
    nor, feeling, to put on false airs:
you're brave, my dear, to fight a whole war inside you
in silence, unmoved by the myths of the age.

Bright, dark eyes, show me the way--
yours was made to love, mine made to pray.

If your mind could have its own way with the world
    you'd set all the prisoners free;
and love--sweet love--would not need a champion;
    nor lover a lie to believe:
the silent greenbrier rose in your heart--
lonely--grows into song.

Bright, dark eyes, show me the way--
yours was made to love, mine made to pray.
