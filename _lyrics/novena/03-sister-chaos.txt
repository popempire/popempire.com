SISTER CHAOS

Long before the world began
she had me in the palm of her hand--
she shook my wrist like the will-o-the-wisp
and darkness hovers over the deep.

Sister Chaos--
that's what she does that's what she do--
that's my old friend, I know her by her ways.

I can't afford to drive in my car--
how am I gonna get where you are?
Shrouds of fathomless nothingness
surround me and I'm bound to your star.

Sister Chaos--
that's what she does that's what she do--
that's my old friend, I know her by her ways.

I feel so low to the ground
I could fall in a puddle and drown.
The moon's down there with her long dark hair,
black habit and her red shoes on.

Here she come, my shadow, Sister Chaos--
bye-bye baby, by and by--
that's my old friend, I know her by her ways--
my old friend, I know her by her ways.
