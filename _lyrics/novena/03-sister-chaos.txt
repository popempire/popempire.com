Long before the world began
She had me in the palm of her hand
She shook my wrist like the will-o-the-wisp
And darkness hovers over the deep

    Sister Chaos
    That's what she does, that's what she do
    That's my old friend
    I know her by her ways

I can't afford to drive in my car
How am I gonna get where you are?
Shrouds of fathomless nothingness
Surround me and I'm bound to your star

    Sister Chaos
    That's what she does, that's what she do
    That's my old friend
    I know her by her ways

I feel so low to the ground
I could fall in a puddle and drown
The moon's down there with her long dark hair
Black habit and her red shoes on

    Here she come—my shadow—Sister Chaos
    Bye-bye baby, by and by
    That's my old friend
    I know her by her ways
    My old friend
    I know her by her ways
