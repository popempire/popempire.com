It's all I really need when I get sadistic,
when wires in my head get so sick and twisted:
all I been thinking about,
the only thing I couldn't doubt,
all that I couldn't live my life without
is real, real good loving.

The danger in your eyes is real, real good loving.
The sharpness of your teeth is real, real good loving.
All I been thinking about
the only thing I couldn't doubt,
all that I couldn't live my life without
is real, real good loving.

Child, when I go now don't you cry--
you gotta get up in the world and make it bright.

I'm locked up in this self for crimes of compassion,
and all I really want is what I can't imagine.
All I been thinking about
the only thing I couldn't doubt,
all that I couldn't live my life without
is real, real good loving.

Child, when I go now don't you cry--
you gotta get up in the world and make it bright.

Baby, if I go now don't you cry--
you're gonna walk in daisy chains of solar light.
