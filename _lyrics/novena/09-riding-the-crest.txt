title: RIDING THE CREST
slug: riding-the-crest
---

Riding on that crest of silver-starlight-
dazzled dim, dark water by the shore
where the soul's own memory roams,
longing fills my heart with pain--
sweet white Moon, and has my love been all in vain?

I been talking with a stranger in my head.
"Fake it till you make it," is what he said.
"Do right like the millionaire do:
sell and make a million too.
Love yourself, just pretend you're someone else."

The wolf said to the lamb, "Now don't you fear,
your father up in heaven brought you here.
When the sun drips into the sea,
you can come and go with me,
preaching the backslide junkies on back to their wandering soul."

Come all you strange, unearthly creatures—
come all you children of the night!
Satan, turn your high beams on,
play my baby's song once more—
riding the crest of the wave down some long-
    forgotten shore.

Riding the crest of the wave down some long-
    forgotten shore.
