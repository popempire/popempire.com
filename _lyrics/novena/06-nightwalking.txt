I go out walking after midnight
Coming down the sky to set you free
    Mama, don't you hear me crying?

You only see the ones in the light

In the high sodium-vapor-yellow
Lonesome air, the silent twilight's fall
    Silhouettes a figure

You only see the ones in the light
Others drift away in the shadow

She goes out somewhere in the darkness
In her eyes, the phosphorescent gleam
    The one I love is ghostly

You only see the ones in the light
Others drift away in the shadow
You only see the ones in the light
Others drift away in the shadow
