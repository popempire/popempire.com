NIGHTWALKING

I go out walking after midnight,
coming down the sky to set you free--
mama, don't you hear me crying?
You only see the ones in the light.

In the high sodium-vapor-yellow
lonesome air, the silent twilight's fall
silhouettes a figure:
you only see the ones in the light,
others drift away in the shadow.

She goes out somewhere in the darkness--
in her eyes, the phosphorescent gleam:
the one I love is ghostly.
You only see the ones in the light,
others drift away in the shadow.

You only see the ones in the light,
others drift away in the shadow.
