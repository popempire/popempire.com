I got friends—so-called friends
They're so sweet and suicidal
Sorta free, sorta brave
So afraid and conflicted

    I get so hung on people
    And I want them to be close
    But I think I'm gonna
    Lose my fucking mind

Yeah yeah yeah!

You know I like you, and I don't care
I'll cut myself to be like you
I wanna love—it hurts to love
I wanna hurt to feel something

    I'm sick, broke, lonely, wasted
    And if I don't leave this place
    God, I think I'm gonna
    Lose my fucking mind

Yeah yeah yeah!

I've hit the wall—I'm freaking out
Lost control, nothing's helping
Hold me now—hold me now
I'm going down in a spiral

    Everything is broken
    And I know it can't be fixed
    God I think I'm gonna
    Lose my fucking mind

Yeah yeah yeah! Yeah yeah yeah!
Yeah yeah yeah! Yeah yeah yeah!
Hold me now—hold me now
I'm going down in a spiral
