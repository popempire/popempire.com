BAD NEWS BOOGIE

I got friends--so-called friends--
they're so sweet and suicidal:
sorta free, sorta brave,
so afraid and conflicted.

I get so hung on people and I want them to be close
but I think I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

Yeah yeah yeah!

You know I like you, and I don't care--
I'll cut myself to be like you.
I wanna love--it hurts to love--
I wanna hurt to feel something.

I'm sick, broke, lonely, wasted, and if I don't leave this place,
god, I think I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

Yeah yeah yeah!

I've hit the wall--I'm freaking out--
lost control, nothing's helping.
Hold me now--hold me now--
I'm going down in a spiral.

Everything is broken and I know it can't be fixed--
god I think I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

Yeah yeah yeah!
