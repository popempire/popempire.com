title: FOOL ALL OVER
---

Lilies of white, roses of red,
myrtle of black and pale amaranth--
o my god, what have I done?
Paranoia's at the door.

The dress is old, the body is new--
sister's eyes of empyrean blue:
o my god, where have you been?
Love don't live here anymore.

I've gone and spent my life
waiting, hanging out--
hanging out--hanging out--
hanging round.

We two are one and the devil is three--
blood from the bark of a dogwood tree:
o my god, how could you forsake me?
I wanna start all over again.

I've gone and spent my life
waiting, hanging out--
hanging out--hanging out--
hanging round.

I've been a fool.
I've been a fool--
I've been a fool all over you.
I'm over you.

I've gone and spent my life
waiting, hanging out--
hanging out--hanging out--
hanging round.
