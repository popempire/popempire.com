Your voice was the first thing that I loved
It called me from a distant place
I've walked the mansion of your mind
Are you also just a visitor here?

    Hey, hey, black wine
    Hey, hey, black wine

I'm free to serve no other master
No words disclose your heart's design
There is no one Iâ€”no window to the world
But blue eternal skies of wonder

    Hey, hey, black wine
    hey, hey, black wine
