Your voice was the first thing that I loved--
it called me from a distant place.
I've walked the mansion of your mind--
are you also just a visitor here?

Hey, hey, black wine--
hey, hey, black wine!

I'm free to serve no other master.
No words disclose your heart's design.
There is no one I--no window to the world
but blue eternal skies of wonder.

Hey, hey, black wine--
hey, hey, black wine!
