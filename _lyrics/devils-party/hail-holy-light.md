I was made from the dark material
Come from the place of the dark Imperial
I was formed in the hand of the Lord
Formed from the dust of the soil ethereal

Hail holy light!
  I am blind, can you heal me?
Hail holy light!
  I am blind, can you feel me?
Hail holy light!
  I am blind, can you heal me?
Hail holy light
  holy light, holy light, aha!

I come from the cities invisible
Come from the last of the cities invincible
I was formed in the furnace of Chaos
Born from the dust of the soil ethereal

[Refrain]

Flesh from flesh, bone from bone
I don't wanna live this life alone

Breathe into me
Breathe into me
Dig into me
Dig into me

[Refrain]
