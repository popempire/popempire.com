    I got a circuit from my fingers to my soul
    A heart that's full of blood and rock & roll
    A mind that's full of lies and fever
    I could be your true believer

    I got a buzz that's like electric in my brain
    Candy and the bottle gonna keep me sane
    Pocket full of pills and flowers
    I don't mind those lonely hours

    I found you coming through my stereo
    Now I know love is true

    Bomb that keeps on ticking in my mind
    Worries keep on leaving me behind
    Engine for the war inside me
    All the king's men just can't divide me

    I got a circuit from my fingers to my soul
    Heart that's full of blood and rock & roll
    Mind that's full of lies and fever
    I could be your true believer

    I found you coming through my stereo
    Now I know love is true
