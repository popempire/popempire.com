    Here she come
    Walking down the avenue
    Riding through the elements
    One wave at a time

    She speaks like a body
    Says Hi like a body
    Goodbye like a body
    One wave at a time

    She's ecstatic
    And chromatic
    Automatic
    One love at a time

    She's extended
    and inflected
    Resurrected
    One love at a time

    There she go
    strapped to the wheel again
    Waiting for the sea again
    like a black rowboat

    She lies a like a body
    suspended in motion
    Across the ocean
    like she don't float

    She's extended
    and inflected
    Resurrected
    One love at a time

    She comes back
    in painted slumbers
    Lines and numbers
    One wave at a time
