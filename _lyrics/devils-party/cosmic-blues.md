    My faithful companion
    The last of the stars
    Died in the glimmer
    Of the alleys and bars

    I washed her bones
    In Ivory soap
    Bid farewell to fear
    Just abandoned hope

    Laid the dry bones down
    In a burlap bag
    Folded her records
    In a dim blue flag

    I borrowed on time
    And I bought this sound
    There's just too many
    Damn pictures around

    I stole my city
    From a wealthier man
    Hid my sins
    In a sodapop can

    Now where are the good ones
    Sweet and far flung?
    Nothing's gonna save us
    Until we are young

    Now it was grace that taught
    My old heart to run
    And when to wait and see

    I never picked my place
    I just picked a speed
    And that's what got me here

    I'm supposed to like the pain
    'Cause I know it's all the same
    With the pleasure in my brain
    And it starts to feel like nothing

    I'm supposed to like the pain
    'Cause I know it's all the same
    With the pleasure in my brain
    And it starts to feel
    Like nothing, nothing, nothing at all
