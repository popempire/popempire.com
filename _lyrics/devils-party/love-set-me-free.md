    Coming to the end again
    I found another friend again
    Golden in the morning
    Golden in the evening

    Dancing in my veins
    Burning in my brains

    Laughing, crying, coughing
    Another nail in the coffin
    Shining in the afternoon
    Hate to see you go so soon

    Dancing in my veins
    Burning in my brains
    Love you set me free
    Love you set me free

    Shadows in the underneath
    Hallows in the deep beneath
    Shining the after dark
    Bending in a silver arc

    Dancing in my veins
    Burning in my brains
    Love you set me free
    Love you set me free

    Rising in the sweet descent 
    Falling through the firmament
    Coming to the end again
    I found another friend again

    Dancing in my veins
    Burning in my brains
    Love you set me free
    Love you set me free
    Love you set me free
    Love you set me free
