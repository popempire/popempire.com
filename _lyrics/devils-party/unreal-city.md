    Friends gather around
    Lend me your ear
    I'm willing to speak
    Are you willing to hear?

    The days seem darker
    There's dark clouds in the air
    You can feel the fire burning
    Catch quickly, nothing's there

        Cry! Cry!
        For this great city
        Cry! Cry!
        For this great city

    You wanna be free
    Better run for your life
    Load every pistol
    Sharpen every knife

    Knock on the door
    And if they won't let you stay
    Kick the dust from your shoes
    Turn and be on your way

        Cry! Cry!
        For this great city
        Cry! Cry!
        For this great city

    Love or lust
    The difference isn't clear
    With so many devils 
    Speaking in your ear

    You wann be free
    You better run while you can
    You'll be shackled and chained
    In your promised land
    You'll be shackled and chained
    In your promised land
    You'll be shackled and chained
    In your promised land

        Cry! Cry!
        For this great city
        Cry! Cry!
        For this great city

        Cry! (cry!) Cry! (cry!)
        For this great city
        Cry! (cry!) Cry! (cry!)
        For this great city
