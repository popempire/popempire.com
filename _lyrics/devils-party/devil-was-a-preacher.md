slug: devil-was-a-preacher

    Because nothing got me chained up
    Nothing sets me free
    I crossed a thousand borders
    But they're never gonna let me be

    It's a hard way of livin'
    Workin' on the getaway
    The only way of livin'
    In the devil's own USA

    Had me a heaven of my own
    But I shared it with the others
    I'm a social kind of guy
    From a long line of lovers

    If my papa was a rascal
    He must have got lucky
    The devil was preacher
    And they shot him in Kentucky

    Put me down
    Put me down with your blessed
    Put me down
    I'm just tryna confess it

    The devil was a preacher
    And he told me, Son
    Gotta get back to your soul
    Take the bullet, take the gun

    Burn it like a motor
    Get ya down the pavement
    Get ya another dollar
    From United States government

    Now, the livin' ain't so pretty
    But she's got some kinda charm
    Don't love me but she keep me
    Out of trouble, out of harm

    Got me a heaven of my own
    Got a heaven in my mind
    Take the money, take the honey
    Take the water, take the wine

    Put me down
    Put me down with your blessed
    Put me down
    'Cause I'm just tryna confess it


#### Reprise 

    Well, it's nothing got me chained up
    'Cause nothing sets me free
    I'm always going home
    But I've always got a place to be

    It's a hard way of livin'
    Workin' on the getaway
    With a heart full of evil
    In the devil's own USA

    Got me a heaven of my own
    But I share it with the others
    Like a social kind of guy
    From a long line of lovers

    And if you wanna be like me
    Because you want to be like me
    Just drink Kentucky whiskey, baby
    Let your cocaine be

    Put me down
    Put me down with your blessed
    Put me down
    I'm just tryna confess it

    The devil was a preacher
    And he told me, Son
    You better get back to your soul
    Take the bullet, take the gun

    Burn it like a motor
    Get ya down the pavement
    Get ya another dollar
    From United States government

    The livin' ain't so pretty
    But she's got some kinda charm
    Don't love me but she keep me
    Out of trouble, out of harm

    I said a heaven of my own
    Got a heaven in my mind
    Take the money, take the honey
    Take the water, take the wine

    Take the wine, boys
