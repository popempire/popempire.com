    Well, I fought so hard
    And I won you fairly
    I took you for your beauty
    I took you from your family

    Summer's singing us to sleep

    Why does your mother hate me?
    Why does the summer take so long?
    My eyes are closing every time
    That I hear your song

    I'm just buzzing around

    Everything is dying
    Why am I laughing?
    I really don't like answers
    Why am I asking?

    Summer's singing us to sleep

    And now those seeds are inside you
    I guess that makes you angry
    You know how much I love you
    I wish that made you happy

    Summer's singing us to sleep

    I'm just buzzing around
    I'm just buzzing around
    I'm just buzzing around
    I'm just buzzing around
