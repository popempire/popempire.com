I got a hole in my soul
  and baby that's alright
I've got a hole in my soul
  and baby that's alright
It don't matter that much to me
  but you could set me free

There ain't nothing to say
  that ain't yet been said
The songs of all the cosmic throngs
  well, they ain't nothing new

I'll be the breeze and I'm gone
  baby I don't mind
In my craft or sullen art
  well, I wanna play the blues

I got a soul on my back
  a monkey in my shoes
I'm just another whitewash boy
  running out of clues

There ain't nothing to do, lord
  that ain't yet been done
It don't matter that much to me
  'cause I wanna play the blues
