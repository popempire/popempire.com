    City girl, city boy
    Living in city noise
    City day, city night
    Living in city light

    Open the door and I step outside
    I hit the street and I take a ride
    People walkin' and they walk on past
    People talkin', they talk so fast
    I'm outta body and I'm outta mind
    I'm feeling good

    I love this city (x4)

    Lights are on, buzz the door
    Up the stairs, second floor
    Come on in, say hello
    A few friends, some Bordeaux

    Records play all the songs we know
    The night is young, there's so far to go
    Memories come cheap, but life comes fast
    The present now will soon be past
    I pour a drink and I step outside
    This city boy in city light
    Yeah, it's been a long time...

    I love this city (x4)
