    The morning, it beckons
    To rise and to work
    The sun brings you promise
    But the day brings you hurt
    The night it comes quickly
    You're dirty and tired
    But a woman is kind

    The Winter, it stings you
    The Spring gets you wet
    The Summer, it burns you
    And you start to sweat
    The Fall, it betrays you
    With a colorful death
    But a woman is kind

    Your friends let you down
    Your family will too
    Police will arrest you
    Without any proof
    And as you lie in jail
    Got one thing on your mind
    A woman is kind

    You look to some money
    But it leaves you broke
    You look to your country
    But it's just a joke
    And nobody wants you
    God don't give a damn
    But a woman is kind

    Woman is kind
    Woman is kind
    Woman is kind
    Woman is kind

    A Woman is kind
