I got free from my pride and passion
I got an edge on my modern fashion
I got a wound and it never heals
I love the way it feels
Let's take a shot, let's all get warm like a gun
We're just having some fun

They'll break your heart but never hurt you
Adolescent modern virtue
Learn to love and avoid temptation
Lost and found in this generation
It's a circus when we wanted a war
It's not fun anymore

Just don't think about it's gonna be alright
I've seen the future, it's out of sight

You're not paying attention
You're not paying attention

Hope's a doll and she's dazzling in green
She thinks that our hearts could come clean
I'm a fool for the lines in her hair
How I love all of the colors she wears
She's a girl of the twenty-first century
Coming down to make her entry
On a rocket so high above
Falling angel radiating love
She's dressed in nighttime and she burns like the sun
