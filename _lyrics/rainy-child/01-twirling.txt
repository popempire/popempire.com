Twirling
by Henry Wilson

You know the literate man
  is full of superstitions
Scientific laws
  and phony apparitions
There's a funny face
  on the man in the mirror
He's all turned around
  and he's creeping nearer

It's a lonely place
  without a visual connection
See the camera wink
  share a secret affection
Got a hole in my head
  and the warmest feeling
These electric lights
  I could float through the ceiling

You know the world is round
  and it keeps on twirling
Like the ancient stars
  or a rainy child
My electric eyes
  my mechanical fingers
The world fades away
  and the spinning lingers
