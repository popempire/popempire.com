    Everybody's talkin' about going down
    To see the show
    I can't wrap my mind around it
    Just look at them go

    Bodies made up of empty spaces
    That never touch
    Circumscribed by a viscous oozing
    Of inarticulate mass

    People always told me
    Life's full of surprises
    It finds a way
    Round and round again

    The king's daughter in a violin string
    Evening gown
    Drives the knife and the fat enfolds it
    God smiling down

    People always told me
    Life's full of surprises
    It finds a way
    Round and round again
