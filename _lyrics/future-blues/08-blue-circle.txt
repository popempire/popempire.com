Blue circle got me all wound up
How could I know till I found out
Come on baby don't you wanna go
My sweet home Ohio
I got a little house at the foot of the hill
fifteen minutes from everywhere
No matter how far I go
I end up knockin at the same old door

I said hey, rider, what you doin here so soon?
You gotta let me get one day out of the seven day week

Blue circle keep me up at night
Black sky electric light
Drinkin booze and wakin up at two
Doin all the work that a man can do
Blue circle got me caught on the line
Straight shot from heaven above
twenty-four hours on a greyhound bys
My own little baby gonna kill my buzz

Hey rider what you doin here so soon?
You gotta let me get one day out of the seven day week
