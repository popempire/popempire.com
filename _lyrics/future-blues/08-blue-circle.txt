Blue circle got me all wound up
How could I know till I found out?
Come on baby don't you wanna go
My sweet home Ohio

I got a little house at the foot of the hill
Fifteen minutes from everywhere
No matter how far I go
I wind up knockin on the same old door

    I said, Hey, rider
    What you doin' here so soon?
    You gotta let me get one day
    Out of the seven day week

Blue circle keep me up at night
Black sky electric light
Drinkin booze and wakin' up at two
Doin' all the work that a man can do

Blue circle got me caught on the line
Straight shot from heaven above
Twenty-four hours on a Greyhound bus
My own little baby gonna kill my buzz

    Hey, rider
    What you doin' here so soon?
    You gotta let me get one day
    Out of the seven day week
