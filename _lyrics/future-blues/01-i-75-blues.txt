I-75 BLUES
==========

I can't tell my future
    I can't tell my past
Can't tell my future
    Can't tell my past
Sure seems like every minute is gonna be my last

I tried to walk on the straight road
    All hustle no luck
I tried to walk on the straight road
    All hustle no luck
I lost my only friend was a long gone pickup truck

Eisenhower's highways
    is a long long crooked line
Eisenhower's highways
    is a long long crooked line
I-75's a groove for my wicked mind

When I first left the backroads
    the moon was shinin bright
When I first left the backroads
    the moon was shinin bright
When I travelled half my home was almost broad daylight

Eisenhower's highways
    is a long long crooked line
Eisenhower's highways
    is a long long crooked line
I-75's a groove for my wicked mind
