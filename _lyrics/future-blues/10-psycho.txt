Can Mary fry some fish, Mama?
I'm as hungry as can be
Oh lordy, how I wish, Mama
You could keep the baby quiet cause my head is killing me

I seen my ex last night, Mama
At a dance at Miller's store
She was with that Jackie White, Mama
I killed 'em both, and they're buried under Jenkins' sycamore

Don't you think I'm psycho, Mama?
You can pour me a cup
If you think I'm psycho, mama
Better let 'em lock me up

Don't hand the dog to me, Mama
I might squeeze him too tight
And I'm as nervous as can be, Mama
But let me tell you 'bout last night

I woke up in Johnny's room, Mama
Standing right by his bed
With my hands near his throat, Mama
Wishing both of us was dead

You think I'm psycho don't you, Mama?
I just killed Johnny's pup
You think I'm psycho don't you, Mama?
You better let 'em lock me up

You know the little girl next door, Mama
I think her name is Betty Clark
Aw, don't tell me that she's dead, Mama
Why I just seen her in the park

She was sittin' on a bench, Mama
Thinking up a game to play
Seems I was holding a wrench, Mama
Then my mind walked away

You think I'm psycho don't you, Mama?
Didn't mean to break your cup
You think I'm psycho don't you, Mama?
Mama, Mama, why don't you get up?

Say something to me, Mama
Mama, why don't you get up?
Mama?
