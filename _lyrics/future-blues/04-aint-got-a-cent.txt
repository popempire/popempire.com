slug: aint-got-a-cent

I work so hard an try to pay my rent
Swear I had the check I don't know where it went
Got it and it's on all in cash
Got it and it's gone all in a flash

    God help me if you can
    But if you can't just let me be
    'Cause I ain't got a cent
    In the land of the free

Jesus sent his people out in the land
said "You shall be known by works of your hands"
But in this country they just don't give a damn
I'm just fingerprints and numbers to old Uncle Sam

    God help me if you can
    But if you can't just let me be
    'Cause I ain't got a cent
    In the land of the free

Almighty dollar don't abide no crime
In love's supreme justice gotta do your time
Young man ain't worth much in the world today
But an old man's broker than two feet of clay

    God help me if you can
    But if you can't just let me be
    'Cause I ain't got a cent
    In the land of the free

Dig my grave with a silver spade
Lay me down with a golden chain
Lay my corporation in six foot of ground
Poor man dig a hole to put the rich man down

    I didn't say I was a millionaire
    But if I was I woulda spent it all
    'Cause I ain't got a cent
    In the land of the free
