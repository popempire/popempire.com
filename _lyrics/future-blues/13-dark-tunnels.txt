Where do they go those dark dark tunnels I've been walkin alone
Cause you're not around and I don't give a fuck about anything else
You know I'm selfish as hell cause no matter where you go
I'm gonna wish that you were in my town
As far as I can see ain't nobody a stone like me

Lover you live just beyond my fingertips
and the day turns to night and then the night never ends
and it's always the same
I think about it all day long and then I drink all night
You can watch me drink all night

And I'm selfish as hell cause no matter where you go
I'm gonna wish that you were in my town
and I just can't seem to keep my feet on the ground
and as far as I can see ain't nobody a stone like me

If I could get so high that all my troubles would just float away from me
You know that I'd be ten miles overhead with angels in my sleeves
