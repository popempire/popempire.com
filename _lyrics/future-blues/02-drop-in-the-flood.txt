Some people want to be a big fish
Lord knows I wanna be a lake
I wanna be an island all to myself
of salt ashes and blood

The monumental everyday vaults up above my world
The underneath coiling infinite strange o well
Just a drop in the flood

Lord o lord what a lonely world I'm in
Got the date and the number just waitin for the show to begin
What a state I'm in
Just a drop in the flood

Suns collide and the world almost ends
Don't mean that much to me
Got the supersonic traveler blues o well
Just a drop in the flood

Lord o lord what a lonely world I'm in
My raven of love my desperate dove o lord
Just a drop in the flood

Some people want to be a big fish
lord knows I want to be a lake
I want to be an island all to myself
Just a drop in the flood
