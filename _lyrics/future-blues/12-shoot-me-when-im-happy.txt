title: Shoot Me When I'm Happy
slug: shoot-me
---

I burned up all my oil, the spark 
    That I once had is gone
My light is spent, it's 3 am
    I don't know how to go on
Take my heart and keep it
    I know I'll make a wreck of it all
It's a long, long, long road
    Ain't got no end

Why should I be lonely
    And lie awake at night?
Sweet black angel gonna spread her wings
    And take me to the other side
Don't mind the people
    The people don't mind me
It's a long, long, long road
    Ain't got no end

Goin' up in a ball of fire
    Goin' up to see the man
Gonna tell him about my troubles down here
    Lord I'm gonna swear raise my right hand
Shoot me when I'm happy
    I ain't goin easy today
It's a long, long, long road
    Ain't got no end

Perfect peace gonna fill me
    Like color fills the sky
All that's good in this passing world
    Sweet heaven when I die
Fade away to nothing
    Everything is gonna work out
It's a long, long, long road
    Ain't got no end
