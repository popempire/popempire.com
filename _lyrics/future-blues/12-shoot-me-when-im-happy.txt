I burned up all my oil the spark that I once had is gone
My light is spent it's 3 am I don't know how to go on
Take my heart and keep it
I know I'll make a wreck of it all
It's a long long long road ain't got no end

Why should I be lonely and lie awake at night?
Sweet black angel gonna spread her wings and take me to the other side
Don't mind the people
The people don't mind me
It's a long long long road ain't got no end

Goin' up in a ball of fire
Goin' up to see the man
Gonna tell him about my troubles down here
Lord I'm gonna swear raise my right hand
Shoot me when I'm happy
I ain't goin easy today
It's a long long long road ain't got no end

Perfect peace gonna fill me like color fill the sky
All that's good in this passing world sweet heaven when I die
Fade away to nothing
Everything is gonna work out
It's a long long long road ain't got no end
